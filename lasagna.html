        <p> Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical 
            lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, 
            such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <h5>Ragu</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium 
                heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook
                 for 10 minutes until softened and sweet they should not brown 
                 (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
            <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking 
                it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu 
                ingredients EXCEPT the sugar</li>
            <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and 
                cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer 
                for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich see video for consistency 
                (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Cheese Sauce</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and 
                mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. 
                Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens about 5 to 8 minutes. It should coat 
                the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still 
                easily pourable the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If its too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Assemble</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
            <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish</li>
            <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets.
                 Tear sheets to fit.</li>
            <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 
                1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets
                 then repeat 1 more time.</li>
            <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, 
                then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
            <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
